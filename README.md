# 📊 My SQL Learning Journey

Welcome! This repo is all about **my adventure learning SQL**.

After countless videos, courses, and exercises, I realized most ways of learning SQL are **tricky, confusing, and overwhelming** — especially for beginners who, like me, aren’t big fans of numbers or math.

I struggled with SQL for a long time. HackerRank challenges and online courses left me **confused and frustrated**. Something always felt missing. So, I decided to create **my own fun, easy, and clear way to learn SQL**.

Here, the focus is on **understanding commands and keywords**, not just memorizing them. Once you grasp the basics, writing SQL becomes as natural as **chatting with a friend** — communicating with the database comfortably to get exactly what you need.

## 🎯 Approach

I’ve divided the journey into **four levels**:

1. 🟢 **Beginner**
2. 🟡 **Intermediate**
3. 🔵 **Advanced**
4. ⚫ **Expert**

Each level builds on the previous one, helping you **grow step by step**.

### 🔹 Beginner Level

The Beginner section is broken into **Level 1–4**, from easy to advanced beginner problems.

For each question, you’ll get:

* 🔹 **Clear explanations** — understand what the question is asking
* 🔹 **Keywords and commands** — learn the right tools to use
* 🔹 **Usage guidance** — know when and why to use each keyword

No more guessing or random command usage. By the end, you’ll be able to **write queries confidently** and handle most beginner problems on your own.

💡 **Goal:**
To **communicate with a database as easily as talking to a human** — asking the right questions, understanding the answers, and pulling exactly the data you need. SQL becomes a conversation, not a puzzle.

Start with **Beginner Level 1**, and work your way up. Each level is designed to make SQL **fun, intuitive, and stress-free**.
